/**
 * Baked unity asset bundles — the blob references behind a room's asset-bundle download.
 *
 * `unity_asset` holds one row per BUILD of a unity asset: the asset's GUID, the `Target`
 * it was built for (0 Windows, 2 Android/Quest — the same numbers a custom avatar's
 * `unityAssetTarget` uses), its `Version`, the `Kind` of bundle (`main`, the scene the
 * client loads; `stripped`, the editor-only variant the Studio upload also stores), and
 * the storage blob the client downloads (`Filename`, fetched as `/room/<Filename>` straight
 * from the shared `recflare-cdn` bucket, and its base64 SHA-256 `Hash`).
 *
 * Two things read it. The client asks for main bundles in bulk from
 * `POST /unity_assets/baked/bulk` (the `rooms` worker) while loading a room — the step
 * Player.log times as `AssetBundle_Download` — and `GET /rooms/{id}` folds the same main
 * bundles onto `CurrentSave.UnitySubAssets`; either way the client then downloads
 * `/room/<Filename>` from the bucket, and a lookup that answers no row,
 * or a row without a `Filename`, simply downloads nothing, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * The `studio` worker writes it: a Rec Room Studio build posts a Windows + Android bundle
 * pair (plus optional stripped ones), stored here at {@link STUDIO_ASSET_VERSION} with the
 * cloud-build record in `studio_cloud_build` (see studio-unity-assets.ts).
 *
 * The `rooms` worker owns the table and its migrations — see
 * apps/rooms/migrations/0024_unity_asset.sql and 0026_unity_asset_kind.sql.
