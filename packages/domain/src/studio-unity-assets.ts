/**
 * Rec Room Studio cloud builds.
 *
 * The editor builds Windows and Android asset bundles on the creator's PC and posts them
 * to the `studio` worker, which stores the bytes in the shared `recflare-cdn` bucket,
 * records each bundle as a row of `unity_asset` (see unity-assets-db.ts — the same table
 * the game's bulk lookup reads) and files the build itself in `studio_cloud_build`, the
 * one table this module describes. The studio migration owns that table; this module
 * reads it, and tests apply {@link STUDIO_CLOUD_BUILD_SCHEMA_DDL} directly.
 *
 * A room load must keep working before that migration has been applied, so a missing
 * table is reported by {@link isMissingStudioAssetTable} and the caller falls back to
 * whatever it knows without the build record.
